Hi!

**This is Miki's TODO app

The mechanism is the usual: 

you can list the tasks with -l

add new task with -a

change task to checked wirh -c

and remove task with -r

However you can simply type "todo -a Sajt" to add Sajt to your task-list as a handy batch-file is present

The app can translate many commandss at once: you can type for example "todo -a Sajt -a Lecke -a Szem√©t -l" to add
three items to the list and print it afterward.

You can delete or check many items at once by giveing multiple indexes: "todo -c 1 3 27" or "todo -r 6 4 2"
