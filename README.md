Hi and Welcome into my Green Fox repository!

You can find here my "finished" code regarding the daily excersises of the course, also I have highlighted some projects for each week, that maybe you'll find interesting.


**Week 1 - HTML & CSS**
  We quickly jumped into the learning about the two essencial building block of the Internet; HTML and CSS
  I have found CSS a really powerfull tool to turn websites into nice, responsive and stylish.
  
**Week 2 - Python basics**
  We got to know the basic sintax and rules of the highly popular Python language
  By the end of this week I could wrote this simplet minesweeper game (notice the colors in the terminal :)

**Week 3 - Python drawing and recursion**
  We dug deeper into the world of Python and got familiar with file operations, drawing (with basic shapes) and recursive functions
  The most interesting part for me was the excersize where we had to draw a starry night. I cannot help but tought about van Gogh and his   famous painting. I tried to "emulate" this painting using simple built-in graphics algoritms.
