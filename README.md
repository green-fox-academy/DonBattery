## Hello and welcome to Miklós Lőrinzi's GreenFox repository


Here you will find my humble projects I have worked on during the Corsac-cohor at
the Green Fox Academy as a member of the BadCat class ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/greenfox-academy/DonBattery/master/badcat1.png)

### CLI Minesweeper

As we started learning about the command line and the wonderful Python language 
one of our mentors gave us the idea to make a simple minesweeper-game, and presented
its basic data-structure and line-drawing method.

I have completed the code and added some nice colors. You can play by entering the
row and column number of the field you want to discover. If you are checking a filed
with no mines nearby, a recursive algorithm auto-discovers its neighbors, just like 
in the old Windows version of the game

### TODO APP

This is a less spectacular project, however I have learned a lot from it (like how to control a file,
how to handle exceptions and how to translate user-input into competent commands) 

This handy CLI app has a 'To do'-list-file that you can read and edit by entering various argomentums
for the program. It can deal with multiple commands entered as a single line.

### Cascading Style PythonS

As we have learned about HTML and CSS the two basic building block of the Internet, and we dessigned colorful
and responsive websites, it came to my mind to write a Python program which generates HTML and CSS files based on
tiny images or some random-algorithm

Right now it is very basic and under construction... However the potential is strong whit this one!

### Coon Runner

This is my biggest project so far. As an old fan of video-games I have took very seriously the game-making 
excersise on the 5th week of the course. I have kept the original idea of a tile-based walker with walls, but
I wanted to make a multiplayer party game in the style of the old Nintendo / SEGA games

The project is still on, wall-drawing, movement, background-music and collosions are working for 2 players. 
More interaction / game-events, gamepad-support, leveleditor, sound effects needs to be added...

### Image Gallery

We had to make a picture gallery on the 7th week of the course. This is my implementation
writen in Python.

It puts all the images found in the gallery/ - library to a list and creates thumbnail.images
for them as well. In the middle it displays the actual image, and at the bottom it displays
the previous the current and the next picture's thumbnail. You can move on the list left
or right with mouse-click or the arrow buttons.
